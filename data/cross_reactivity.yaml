  - source: dairy
    target: beef
    confidence: low
    notes: "Some people with milk allergy may react to beef due to bovine serum albumin"
    
  - source: dairy
    target: goat_milk
    confidence: high
    notes: "Goat milk contains similar proteins to cow's milk; high cross-reactivity"
    
  - source: peanuts
    target: tree_nuts
    confidence: medium
    notes: "About 25-40% of peanut-allergic individuals also react to tree nuts"
    
  - source: tree_nuts
    target: peanuts
    confidence: low
    notes: "Cross-reactivity is less common from tree nuts to peanuts"
    
  - source: shellfish
    target: dust_mites
    confidence: low
    notes: "Both contain tropomyosin protein; some cross-reactivity possible"
    
  - source: shellfish
    target: insects
    confidence: low
    notes: "Arthropod cross-reactivity due to shared proteins"
    
  - source: fish
    target: shellfish
    confidence: low
    notes: "Different protein structures; cross-reactivity is rare but processing contamination is common"
    
  - source: soy
    target: other_legumes
    confidence: low
    notes: "Some cross-reactivity with peas, lentils, and beans possible"
    
  - source: wheat

    confidence: low
    notes: "May cross-react with other gluten-containing grains (barley, rye)"
